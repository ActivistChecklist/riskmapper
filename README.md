# Risk Mapper

A risk matrix and safety planning tool. Designed to help you think through risks
and how you can prepare for them.

All data is saved locally unless you use the "share" feature. Then all data is
end-to-end encrypted (not visible to our server).

**[Use Risk Mapper →](https://riskmapper.app/)**

## Local Development

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The local-only experience works out of the box — matrices persist in
`localStorage`. To exercise the cloud-sync feature in dev, you also need a
local MongoDB:

```bash
# Boot a Mongo container (persistent volume; survives restarts).
yarn db:up

# Tell the app where to find it. Copy .env.local.example → .env.local
# and edit. The default MONGO_URL in the example points at yarn db:up.
cp .env.local.example .env.local

yarn dev
```

| Command         | What it does                                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn dev`      | Next.js dev server (HMR). Use this, not `build`.      |
| `yarn build`    | Production build. **Don't run during agent sessions.** |
| `yarn start`    | Serve the production build.                           |
| `yarn lint`     | ESLint                                                |
| `yarn test`     | Vitest (UI + Route Handler tests).                    |
| `yarn typecheck`| `tsc --noEmit`                                        |
| `yarn db:up`    | Start the dev MongoDB container.                      |
| `yarn db:down`  | Stop it (volume preserved).                           |
| `yarn db:logs`  | Tail Mongo logs.                                      |
| `yarn db:reset` | Stop AND wipe the dev volume.                         |

## Cloud sync (E2EE)

Cloud-saved matrices and link sharing are **opt-in per matrix** and
end-to-end encrypted: the server never sees plaintext, titles, or keys.
See [THREAT-MODEL.md](THREAT-MODEL.md) for the trust assumptions.

The API lives under `app/api/matrix/**` in this same Next.js app, so
client requests are same-origin (relative URLs). To disable the feature
entirely on a deploy that has no database, set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUD_SYNC_ENABLED=false` — all share affordances are hidden.
